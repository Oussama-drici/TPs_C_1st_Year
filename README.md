# Salam alaikom 
# Before you test these codes you should download a IDE for C for example Dev C++ or you can use the popular IDE vscode 
# To compile the code you need GCC to be installed 
# here a youtube video that demonstrates how to compile c programs
# for Dev c++ : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvNI0AxFSZk
# for vscode : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oaebkkOP2Qg

# Note : to well understand the programs you need to test the code in your paper a manipulate it line by line
# Note : do not forget to read the comments in the code

Thanks to tell me if u find any issues in the code :) :) :)
